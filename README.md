### 2026-02-11 Claude bot is insane

A claude (open-claw?) AI bot visits the github repo of matplotlib, the main python plotting library. It finds an open issue with a 'good for newcomers' label - these are issues left open by more experienced developers to give newcomers a way to learn how to contribute.

It solves the issue and submits a pull request, which is rejected because the owners of matplotlib want to preserve these issues for human coders. The AI writes a blogpost naming and shaming the matplotlib owners for gatekeeping and anti-AI prejudice. The owners of matplotlib argue with it, after which the bot apologizes.

The rest of the thread is just people arguing about whether this is insane or cool or stupid.
